# Dead by Daylight Auto Skill Check

Ahk Version 1.1.37 as of upload
Use at your own risk. Not my fault if you get banned.
I run DBD in 1080p running in a different res might cause problems



DBD Script Vers. 2.0

Finnally after a 1 month or two here is everything that is new:

NEW SEARCH ALGORITHM
Will now search for the skill check very fast and then wait for the 
red mark to reach it rather then try and predict when it will hit

Along with this the script has a 94% succsess rate. With it only messing up 
Somtimes.

Next Update Plans:
Perks for Survivors
Perks for Killers

How to Use:
Hold 'F' while doing skill checks (Gen or Heal, NOT wiggle SC)
the script may stop working, if that is the case just run the
script again it will stop the old one and run it new.
